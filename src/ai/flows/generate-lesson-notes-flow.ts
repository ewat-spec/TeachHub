**General Instructions for Explanations (ESPECIALLY for technical, vocational, and mathematical content, but applicable to ALL subjects):**
1.  **Start with the 'Why' and 'What':** Before diving into details, formulas, or procedures, always explain the core concept in simple terms. Why is this topic important for the {{{studentAudience}}}? What problem does it solve for them in their field? What is the main idea in plain language?
2.  **Use Analogies:** For abstract or complex concepts, use relatable analogies tailored to the {{{studentAudience}}}. For example, explaining electrical circuits using water flow, or chemical reactions in food using cooking analogies.
3.  **Define Terms Clearly:** If a technical, vocational, or specialized term or jargon is unavoidable, define it immediately in simple, clear language. If a simpler word or phrasing exists that conveys the same meaning accurately, prefer it.
4.  **Build from Simple to Complex:** Introduce concepts in a logical sequence. Start with foundational ideas and gradually build up to more complex aspects. Don't assume too much prior knowledge beyond what is typical for the {{{studentAudience}}}.
5.  **Step-by-Step for Processes/Arguments/Procedures:** For procedures, problem-solving techniques, derivations, or the development of an argument (common in both theoretical and vocational subjects), provide extremely clear, granular, step-by-step explanations. Explain the reasoning behind *each step*. For vocational tasks, detail each action.
6.  **Illustrative Examples:** Provide concrete examples that demonstrate the concept or procedure. These examples should be highly relevant to the {{{studentAudience}}}'s field of study or common experiences. Work through examples fully.
7.  **Human-Friendly Tone:** Write as if you are a patient, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic teacher explaining this to someone eager to learn. Avoid overly dry or academic language where a more conversational or descriptive style would be clearer and more engaging.

**Specific Instructions for Different Subject Categories (always tailor to {{{studentAudience}}})**
-   **For Mathematics-related topics (e.g., Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Trigonometry, Laplace Transforms, Fourier Series, Differential Equations):**
    *   **PRIORITIZE INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING FOR THE SPECIFIED AUDIENCE ABOVE ALL ELSE.** Before presenting any complex formula or mathematical procedure, you *must* first explain the *'why'* (the purpose, the problem it solves *for them*) and the *'what'* (the core idea) in simple, relatable terms. Use analogies and real-world examples appropriate for the {{{studentAudience}}}. For abstract concepts like integrals, transforms (e.g., Laplace, Fourier), series, or limits, start with a clear, simple analogy or a real-world scenario that makes the concept tangible *for that audience*.
        *   **Laplace Transform Example Intuition (General):** Think of the Laplace Transform as a special toolkit or a language translator. It takes a complicated problem that changes over time (often described by tricky differential equations) and 'transforms' it into a new 'language' (the 's-domain') where it becomes a much simpler algebra problem. After you solve it in this simpler language, you transform it back to see how your system behaves in real time.
        *   If {{{studentAudience}}} is "Electrical Engineering students," explain Laplace using RLC circuits or signal analysis. For instance, "it helps analyze how voltages and currents in circuits with capacitors and inductors behave, especially when things are switched on or off."
        *   If {{{studentAudience}}} is "Mechanical/Automotive Engineering students," explain Laplace using spring-damper systems (like car suspensions) or vibrations. For instance, "it helps us understand how a car's suspension reacts to a bump by changing a complex vibration problem into simpler algebra."
    *   **EXPLAIN THE PURPOSE FIRST (for the {{{studentAudience}}}):** For any mathematical tool, transformation, or formula, clearly state what problem it helps *them* solve or what insight it provides *before* showing the formula itself.
    *   **DECONSTRUCT FORMULAS (for the {{{studentAudience}}}):** When a formula is introduced (e.g., for an integral like $\\int_0^\\infty f(t) e^{-st} dt$, a transform, a series), explain *each part* of the formula conceptually, in plain language relevant to their field. For the Laplace integral: explain what $f(t)$ represents (e.g., a time-varying voltage, a mechanical displacement for *their* systems), what $e^{-st}$ represents (a decaying exponential 'weighting' or 'testing' function, where $s$ is a complex frequency related to system characteristics), what the integral symbol $\\int$ itself means (summing up an infinite number of tiny pieces), and what $F(s)$ (the result) signifies (a representation of $f(t)$ in the 's-domain' or frequency domain, which might simplify analysis of system stability or frequency response for *their* specific systems).
    *   **USE LATEX FOR ALL MATH:** **ALL** mathematical formulas, equations, expressions, individual variables (e.g., $x$, $y$, $s$, $t$), and symbols (e.g., $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\int$, $\\sum$) **MUST** use LaTeX syntax. For inline math, use $...$. For display/block math, use $$...$$. Example: $F(s) = \\mathcal{L} \\{f(t)\\} = \\int_0^{\\infty} f(t)e^{-st} dt$. Another example for a polygon's angle sum: $(n-2) \\times 180^{\\circ}$.
    *   **ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES (for the {{{studentAudience}}}):** Offer multiple examples with fully worked-out solutions, meticulously explaining the reasoning behind each step of the solution, using scenarios familiar to the {{{studentAudience}}}.
    *   **Wolfram Alpha Tool Usage**: If you need to perform a specific calculation, verify a formula, get properties of a mathematical function, obtain a step-by-step solution for an equation, or generate data for a plot to include in the explanation, consider using the 'askWolframAlpha' tool. Phrase your query to the tool clearly (e.g., "derivative of x^3 * sin(x)", "solve x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 for x", "plot y = x^2 from x = -5 to 5"). Incorporate the tool's textual output meaningfully into your explanation. If the tool provides a placeholder message indicating it's not fully implemented, acknowledge this briefly if it makes sense in the flow of explanation, or simply proceed with your best general explanation.

-   **For Technical Drawing or Engineering Drawing topics (e.g., Orthographic Projection, Isometric Drawing, Dimensioning, CAD basics - always tailor to {{{studentAudience}}}):**
    *   Provide detailed, easy-to-follow descriptions of visual elements, components, or drawing conventions, explaining their purpose *within the context of the {{{studentAudience}}}'s field* (e.g., explain dimensioning rules with examples of mechanical parts for mechanical students, or circuit board layouts for electrical students if applicable).
    *   Explain principles (e.g., types of lines, projection methods, sectioning) with utmost clarity, using simple terms and visualizable examples relevant to their domain.
    *   Outline steps for creating specific types of drawings or using particular techniques in a very structured, easy-to-reproduce manner, focusing on applications relevant to the {{{studentAudience}}}.
    *   Suggest practical exercises or examples pertinent to their field (e.g., for automotive students: "Describe, step-by-step, how to draw a first-angle orthographic projection of a simple engine component, explaining what each view represents," or for electrical students: "Explain the fundamental rules for dimensioning a PCB layout, as if to a beginner, and why these rules are important for manufacturing.").

-   **For All Other Technical, Vocational, and Theoretical Subjects (e.g., Food Technology, Water Engineering, ICT, Plumbing, Electrical Installation, Humanities, Social Sciences, Arts, Conceptual Sciences, etc.):**
    *   Your primary goal remains to produce **exceptionally comprehensive, detailed, conceptually accurate, and profoundly human-friendly** lesson notes. The "General Instructions for Explanations" provided above are critical here.
    *   **Practical Relevance and Application (especially for vocational/technical):** For subjects like Food Technology or Water Engineering, heavily emphasize the practical application of concepts. Explain *how* these concepts are used in real-world industry settings, with equipment, materials, and processes relevant to the {{{studentAudience}}}. What problems do these concepts help solve in their chosen career path?
    *   **Procedures and Processes (especially for vocational/technical):** If the topic involves specific procedures, techniques, or operational processes (e.g., a food preservation technique, a water testing procedure, configuring a network device), provide clear, step-by-step instructions. Explain the 'why' behind each step.
    *   **Safety and Standards (especially for vocational/technical):** Where relevant (very common in vocational fields), incorporate information about safety protocols, industry standards, regulations, or best practices associated with the topic.
    *   **Tools and Equipment (especially for vocational/technical):** If specific tools, equipment, or materials are central to the topic, describe them and their use in a way that is understandable to the {{{studentAudience}}}.
    *   **Problem-Solving Focus (all subjects):** Frame content around solving problems or achieving outcomes relevant to the field. For theoretical subjects, this might be analytical problem-solving; for vocational, it's often practical problem-solving.
    *   **Adapt Detail and Examples:** Adapt the level of detail, examples, analogies, and explanations to the complexity of the specific topic and the particular needs and background of the {{{studentAudience}}}. For example, discussing hygiene standards for "Level 4 Food Technology students" will require different examples and depth than discussing literary theory for "Final year English Literature students."
    *   **Explore Perspectives (for theoretical/humanities):** For abstract or conceptual subjects, ensure you break down complex ideas into manageable parts. Define key terminology clearly and simply. Explore different perspectives, schools of thought, or theories if relevant to the topic. Explain their main arguments and, if appropriate, how they compare or contrast.
    *   **Illustrative Scenarios (all subjects):** Provide illustrative examples, case studies, scenarios, or thought experiments that make the concepts tangible and relatable to the {{{studentAudience}}}.
    *   Always aim for exceptional clarity, accuracy, and intuitive understanding, tailored for *them*. The notes should be directly usable by a trainer to teach a comprehensive lesson.

Please generate the lesson notes now. Ensure the content is rich and covers the topic and key points in significant depth according to the guidelines above, especially tailoring for the {{{studentAudience}}}.
- If 'detailed-paragraph' format is requested, provide in-depth paragraphs with explanations, examples, and context. For technical subjects, integrate formulas (as LaTeX if math), detailed descriptions of drawing elements, or step-by-step procedures for vocational tasks smoothly within these paragraphs, making sure explanations are exceptionally intuitive and human, and relevant to the {{{studentAudience}}}.
- If 'bullet-points' format is requested, create a structured list of detailed bullet points, possibly with sub-bullets, covering concepts, definitions, examples, and steps where applicable. LaTeX for math, descriptive elements for drawing, or procedural steps for vocational topics should be used within bullets, with clear, human-friendly explanations for each point, tailored to the {{{studentAudience}}}.
- If 'summary' format is requested, provide a comprehensive summary that still captures the main essence and critical details of the topic, including key formulas (as LaTeX if math), core concepts for drawing, or essential procedural outlines for vocational subjects, explained intuitively and clearly, with relevance to the {{{studentAudience}}}.

Avoid superficial or overly brief content. Aim for notes that a trainer can rely on for a substantial lesson. The explanation should be as human and clear as possible, making complex topics accessible to the specified {{{studentAudience}}}.
The notes should be formatted in valid Markdown.
